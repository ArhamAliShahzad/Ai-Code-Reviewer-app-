❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to potential errors or reliance on global variables.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and tightly coupled to external variables.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc comments

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Accepts two arguments `a` and `b`, making it reusable and independent.
* ✔ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
* ✔ Includes JSDoc comments to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
